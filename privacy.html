  <p>All Day HD (&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;, &quot;our&quot;) is an educational website focused on ADHD in girls and teens. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect personal data when you use this website.</p>

    <li><strong>Newsletter sign-up</strong>: name, email address, and your stated ADHD challenge (optional)</li>
    <li><strong>Contact form</strong>: name, email address, and any information you choose to include in your message</li>
    <li><strong>Technical data</strong>: basic technical information provided by your browser (e.g., IP address, browser type) as part of normal web server logs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top:32px;">3. How we use your data</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Newsletter</strong>: to send you email updates, focus tips, and resources you have opted in to receive</li>
    <li><strong>Contact form</strong>: to respond to your questions or requests</li>
    <li><strong>Site safety and performance</strong>: to keep the website secure and functioning correctly</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top:32px;">4. Legal bases for processing (GDPR)</h2>
  <p>Under the EU/UK GDPR we rely on the following legal bases:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Consent</strong> – for sending marketing emails and newsletters</li>
    <li><strong>Legitimate interests</strong> – for keeping the site secure and understanding basic usage (without profiling)</li>
  </ul>

  <h2 style="margin-top:32px;">5. Email provider (Brevo)</h2>
  <p>We use Brevo (formerly Sendinblue) as our email service provider. When you subscribe to the newsletter, your name, email address, and optional &quot;biggest ADHD challenge&quot; are stored in Brevo so we can send you emails. Brevo acts as our data processor and processes your data on our behalf in accordance with GDPR.</p>

  <h2 id="cookies" style="margin-top:32px;">6. Cookies and similar technologies</h2>
  <p>At this time we do not use analytics or advertising cookies on this site. We use only:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Essential cookies / storage</strong> – for example, <code>sessionStorage</code> used by the on-page focus timer so it remembers your session while you browse</li>
    <li><strong>Google Fonts</strong> – fonts are loaded from Google Fonts, which may receive your IP address as part of serving the font files</li>
  </ul>
  <p>If we introduce analytics or advertising cookies in the future, we will update this policy and request your consent before setting them.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:32px;">7. Data retention</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>Access the personal data we hold about you</li>

We do not knowingly collect personal data from children under 13 without parental involvement.</p>

  <h2 style="margin-top:32px;">10. Data security</h2>
  <p>We use HTTPS and industry-standard technical measures to protect your data. However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.</p>
